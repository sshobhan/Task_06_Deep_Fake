# Task_06_Deep_Fake

This project builds on **Task 05** (F1 Sprint Race Analysis) by turning those insights into a deepfake-style interview.

## Process
1. Summarized findings from Task 05 into a clear Q&A script.
2. Generated script from ChatGPT.
3. Created a short AI-generated video with D-ID using text to video feature.
4. Documented steps, tools, and challenges faced during the process.

## Tools Used
- D-ID (AI Avatar Video)
- CapCut for minor editing and adding captions.
- -ChatGPT

## Reflections
- Free tools were easy to use but limited in export quality.
- The AI-generated interview made the analysis more engaging and interactive.
